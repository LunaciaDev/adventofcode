# Advent of Code Solutions
**Author:** Lunacia

This is the repository for my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzle solutions using Python. 
I do Advent of Code for fun and to explore more concept that I may or may not know about.  

## Organization

Solution are organized by year, then date.  
Within a solution is the input file and the solution code, sometime a file explaining the problem if I feel that it is necessary.
The solution code will get the input data from the input file.  

## Running
To run the project:

1. Install Python
2. Clone the repo
3. Take the input from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and put it in the input file at root.
4. Run the solution: `python "[year]/Day [day]/solution.py"`

## Additional Dependencies

I try to solve all the problem while only using the standard Python library, so no additional dependencies is required.
